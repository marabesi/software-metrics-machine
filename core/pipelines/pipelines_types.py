"""Typed definitions for GitHub workflow runs and jobs used by pipelines_repository.py

This module declares TypedDicts that document the fields accessed across
`providers/github/workflows/pipelines_repository.py` and related viewers.

Two primary types are provided:
- PipelineRun: represents a workflow run (often called "run" or "workflow")
- PipelineJob: represents a job execution attached to a run

A convenience alias `Pipeline` points to PipelineRun for places that expect a
single type name called "Pipeline".
