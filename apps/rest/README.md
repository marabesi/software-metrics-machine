# @smmachine/rest

NestJS REST API for Software Metrics Machine. Serves all metrics over HTTP and is consumed by the webapp dashboard.

## Data mutability boundary

The REST API is strictly read-only.

- It must serve data that was previously generated and persisted by CLI commands.
- It must not generate analysis artifacts, write files, or persist snapshots.
- Any feature that needs data generation (including architecture models) must run in CLI first.

## Supported data sources

- **GitHub**: pull requests, pipeline runs, CI/CD jobs
- **Jira**: issues, changelogs, comments
- **SonarQube**: quality measures, component tree, historical measures
- **Git / CodeMaat**: code churn, coupling, entity effort, pairing index

## Running

### Dev mode (recommended for local development)

```bash
# From the repo root
SMM_STORE_DATA_AT=./.data pnpm --filter @smmachine/rest dev
```

Server starts on `http://localhost:8000` (or `$PORT`).

### Via Docker

```bash
# From the repo root
docker compose up api
```

Uses port `8000` and mounts the current directory. See `docker-compose.yml` for full config.

### Via `smm dashboard serve`

When started through the CLI bundled mode, the REST API runs on port `3001` by default (configurable with `--rest-port`).

## Configuration

The REST API does not use per-variable env vars for credentials. It reads everything from `smm_config.json` located at the path given by `SMM_STORE_DATA_AT`.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SMM_STORE_DATA_AT` | yes | Path to the data directory containing `smm_config.json` |
| `PORT` | no | Port to listen on (default: 8000) |
| `NODE_ENV` | no | `development` or `production` |

See [apps/cli/README.md](../cli/README.md) for the full `smm_config.json` schema.
