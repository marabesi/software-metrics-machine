# What is Software Metrics Machine (SSM)?

Software Metrics Machine (SSM) is a comprehensive tool designed to provide actionable insights into the health and performance of software development teams. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on story points to measure progress, SSM focuses on data-driven metrics that reflect the true dynamics of software development processes.

## The Problem with Story Points

Story points have long been used as a measure of progress in Agile software development. However, they often fail to capture the complexities of real-world software projects. Story points:

- Are subjective and vary between teams and individuals.
- Do not account for team dynamics, waiting times, or code quality.
- Provide limited insights into technical debt, code churn, or pipeline health.

These limitations can lead to misaligned priorities, inefficiencies, and a lack of actionable feedback for improving team performance.

## How SSM Solves This Problem

SSM addresses these challenges by offering a data-driven approach to software metrics. It collects and analyzes data from various sources, including:

- **Pipeline Metrics**: Tracks success rates and average completion times to ensure a stable and efficient development pipeline.
- **Pull Request Metrics**: Provides insights into the average time PRs remain open, helping teams identify bottlenecks and improve collaboration.
- **Git History Metrics**: Analyzes code churn, hotspots, and change frequency to highlight areas of technical debt and opportunities for improvement.

By focusing on these metrics, SSM enables teams to:

- Make informed decisions based on real data rather than subjective estimates.
- Identify and address inefficiencies in the development process.
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration.
