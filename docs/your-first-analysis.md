# Your first analysis

This guide will walk you through the steps to perform your first analysis using Software Metrics Machine. By the end of this guide, you will have fetched data from a GitHub repository and visualized key metrics to gain insights into your software development process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A GitHub account and a repository you want to analyze.
* A personal access token with the necessary permissions (refer to the [GitHub guide](./
github.md#generating-the-github-token) for details).
* Python 3.10+ and Poetry installed on your machine.
* Java installed on your machine.
