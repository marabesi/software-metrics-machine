# Pipelines

The pipelines section is at the core of any CI/CD system. It provides a high-level overview of the pipelines that have
been executed, their statuses, and key metrics related to their performance at a glance. It focuses on first, a quick
statuses run for the pipelines, and second, on the time it takes to run them.
