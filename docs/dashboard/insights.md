# Insights

The insights section of the dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics and trends derived from your data.
It includes visualizations such as the time that it takes to land code in production. It plots in months, weeks and days.

## Deployment Frequency

Deployment Frequency measures how often code is deployed to production. A higher deployment frequency indicates a more
agile and responsive development process.
