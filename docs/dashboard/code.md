# Source code

The Code Metrics Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your project's source code
health and evolution. Designed for software developers and team leads, this section offers
actionable insights into code quality, complexity, and change patterns. By visualizing key
metrics, the dashboard helps you identify areas for refactoring, monitor technical debt,
and track the impact of development practices over time.

## Code churn

A stacked bar chart showing the total number of lines added (blue) and deleted (red) across
the entire repository on a given date.

### Type of Chart

Stacked bar chart showing lines added (blue) and deleted (red) per day.

### Insight Provided

Reveals the rhythm of development activity, highlighting periods of intense work, refactoring, or inactivity. It helps
you spot major events and understand the overall pace of your team's coding efforts.

### Example Usage

Use this chart to identify when large features were merged, when refactoring happened, or to monitor the impact of
sprints. For example, a spike in both additions and deletions may indicate a major refactor.

### How It Computes and Filters

Aggregates commit data by day, counting lines added and deleted. You can filter by date range and interact with the chart
to see which commits contributed to the churn on a specific day.

## Entity Churn

Entity churn reveals which files in your project are changed most often. This chart helps you pinpoint hotspots—files
that may need refactoring, more tests, or architectural review. With powerful filtering options, you can exclude generated
files or focus on the top N most frequently changed files. This makes it easy to find areas of your codebase that require
attention and improvement.

### Type of Chart

Bar chart showing code churn by file, focusing on the top N most frequently changed files.

### Insight Provided

Pinpoints hotspots in your codebase—files that are changed most often. This helps you identify candidates for refactoring,
more tests, or architectural review.

### Example Usage

Use this chart to find files that are frequently modified, which may need attention. For example, if a configuration
file is always changing, it might be a source of bugs or instability.

### How It Computes and Filters

Counts lines added and deleted per file, then ranks files by total churn. Filtering options let you exclude generated
files, vendor directories, or focus on the top N entries for meaningful insights.

## Entity Effort

The entity effort chart shows how much work has gone into each file, measured by the number of commits. This visualization
helps you understand which files are under constant development and which are more stable. Use this chart to identify
files that may be over-engineered, need simplification, or are critical to your project’s success. The treemap format
makes it easy to see the distribution of effort at a glance.

### Type of Chart

Treemap where each rectangle's size represents the number of commits for a file.

### Insight Provided

Shows which files require the most effort and attention, helping you spot files under constant development or those that
are more stable.

### Example Usage

Use this chart to identify files that are frequently updated, which may be critical or over-engineered. For example, a
README.md with many revisions may indicate evolving documentation needs.

### How It Computes and Filters

Counts the number of commits per file and visualizes the distribution. You can filter by file type or directory to
focus on specific areas of your codebase.

## Entity Ownership

Entity ownership highlights who has contributed to each file, showing the breakdown of changes by author. This chart is
invaluable for understanding code expertise and team collaboration. It helps you quickly find out who to ask for help or
a review on specific files, and supports onboarding by making team knowledge visible. The chart is interactive, allowing
you to explore contributions and filter by author or file.

### Type of Chart

Stacked bar chart showing lines changed per file, broken down by author.

### Insight Provided

Highlights code ownership and expertise, making it easy to see who contributed most to each file. This supports
collaboration and onboarding by showing who to ask for help or reviews.

### Example Usage

Use this chart to identify the main contributors to critical files, or to balance code ownership across the team. For example,
if one author owns most of a security module, ensure others are familiar with it too.

### How It Computes and Filters

Aggregates lines added and deleted per file, attributing changes to each author. You can filter by author, file,
or date range, and interact with the chart to explore contributions in detail.
